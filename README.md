# Hospital Demo Project

## High St. Hospital

## Objective

Students will employ good software design and testing principles in order to create a class hierarchy using APIE (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance and Encapsulation).
Students will be able to define super, abstract, extends, implements, is-a and instanceof

## The Scenario

High St. Hospital is an organizational mess. They have unkempt files of employee information scattered throughout manilla folders, computer data files, and old tin filing cabinets (ok ok so its not 1992…but we needed a situation!). With the madness of the daily grind, patients are the priority. But the upmost care cannot be given to the patients if the hospital is disorganized. High St. Hospital wants to get it together. They have subcontracted We Can Code IT full-stack apprentices (who work for the reasonably inexpensive price of free) to come in and organize. They enable you to set up shop with a few company laptops in an old dissheveled break room. Your mission is to create a set of classes that contain information on the employees at Hammond Hospital:

### High St. Hospital has the following model at its facility:

- Employee
  - calculatePay() abstract method with no specifications
  - appropriate getter methods and toString()
- Patient
  - default BLOOD_LEVEL of 20
  - default HEALTH_LEVEL of 10

### High St. Hospital has the following classifications at its facility

- Doctor is a type of Hospital Employee and gets paid 90,000
- Nurse is a type of Hospital Employee and gets paid 50,000
- Surgeon is a type of Doctor and gets paid 120,000
- Receptionist is a type of Hospital Employee and gets paid 45,000
- Janitor is a type of Hospital Employee and gets paid 40,000

### The Data

The following Instance Data will need to be taken care of for each employee

- Employee: Employee Name, Employee Number
- Doctor: Employee Name, Employee Number, Specialty Area (Heart, Brain, Foot, etc…)
- Surgeon: Employee Name, Employee Number, Specialty Area, and whether they are operating or not)
- Nurse: Employee Name, Employee Number, and Number of Patients they are taking care of
- Receptionist: Employee Name, Employee Number, whether they are on the phone or not
- Janitor: Employee Name, Employee Number, whether they are sweeping or not

### Special Duties

Not all employees in the hospital have the same capabilities. Only certain staff members can implement MedicalDuties such as drawBlood() and careForPatient()

## Part 1

Let’s get organized. Your team is meeting for the first time at High St. Hospital. Programming at this time is out of the question. You need to get a feel for the task at hand. You do not even want to create an algorithm yet.

Diagram the classes you will need for this program. What are the inheritance relationships? How and where does the problem tell you this information?

## Part 2

Let’s prepare a project where we can test drive information

## Part 3

We can stare at this stuff all we want but until we actually make some software, High St. Hospital will have patients that are not being served with the best possible care. Time is of the essence! Hurry up, but take your time…

Our first iteration of this new software…

Here are the employees at High St. Hospital
Phil    111    Brain
Harry    222    Plastic    true
Jackie    333    6
Janine    444    true
Rosie    555    true

Here are the pay rates at High St. Hospital
Phil gets paid a salary of 90000 per year.
Harry gets paid a salary of 120000 per year.
Jackie gets paid a salary of 50000 per year.
Janine gets paid a salary of 45000 per year.
Rosie gets paid a salary of 40000 per year.

Some Employees can draw blood
Phil is capable of drawing blood.
Harry is capable of drawing blood.
Jackie is capable of drawing blood.

Some Employees can administer patient care
Phil has increased patient health to 20
Harry has increased patient health to 20
Jackie has increased patient health to 15
As you look at this output to the console, the true/false attached to some of the employees simply represents the state they are in relative to if they are currently involved in their jobs or not.

## Part 4

Stretch task: Tina is an EmergencyDispatcher. She is a trained medical professional and a first responder. She also has great people skills and can answer calls and manage what ambulance gets sent to a situation. She sometimes joins the crew and respondes to calls on the fly. Add her as an employee and give her the proper functionality. This job pays 45,000.
Stretch task: Through user input, type search for an employee by name and access their info/what they are doing
Stretch task: add an employee, fire an employee#  <#Title#>
